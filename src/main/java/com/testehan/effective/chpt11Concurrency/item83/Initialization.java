        This code may appear a bit convoluted. In particular, the need for the local
        variable (result) may be unclear. What this variable does is to ensure that field
        is read only once in the common case where itâ€™s already initialized. While not
        strictly necessary, this may improve performance and is more elegant by the standards applied to low-level
        concurrent programming. On my machine, the method above is about 1.4 times as fast as the obvious version without
         a local variable.
